TBA
1. add proxy switcher support for javdb monitoring (solved by Meta kernel) 
2. regional proxy filtering 'jp','US','HK(native)','native online game unlock','AE86(for the fastest response time)' #apply emoji
3. URL-test for regional proxy

Remain issues:
1. rules for DIRECT connect trackers unreachable (DNS pollution maybe)
2. possible solution for ipv6 traffic policies (with ipv6 proxies filter)
